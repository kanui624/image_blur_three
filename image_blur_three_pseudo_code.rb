#Build a a method called 'blur' then
  #Set it to expect 1 argument then
    #Set that argument to default to the value of '1' if no argmuent is given then
      #create a 'times loop' then will execute the code from the 'image_blur_two' challenge based on the value of the given argument then
        #output the 'blur' method in the 'image' class specifying an argument in integer form
